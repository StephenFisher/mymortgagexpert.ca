        <p>Buying your first home is one of the biggest financial decisions you'll ever make. The mortgage you choose will shape your finances for years to come, so getting it right matters. This guide walks you through everything you need to know as a first-time buyer in Canada &mdash; from how much you actually need for a down payment to the government programs designed to help you get into the market.</p>

        <h2>How Much Do You Need for a Down Payment?</h2>
        <p>In Canada, the minimum down payment depends on the purchase price of the home:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>$500,000 or less:</strong> 5% of the purchase price</li>
          <li><strong>$500,001 to $1,499,999:</strong> 5% on the first $500,000, plus 10% on the portion above $500,000</li>
          <li><strong>$1,500,000 or more:</strong> 20% of the purchase price</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, on a $600,000 home, you'd need $25,000 (5% of $500K) plus $10,000 (10% of $100K) = $35,000 minimum down payment. That said, the more you put down, the less you borrow and the lower your monthly payments will be.</p>

        <h2>What Is Mortgage Default Insurance (CMHC)?</h2>
        <p>If your down payment is less than 20% of the purchase price, you'll need mortgage default insurance &mdash; commonly called CMHC insurance, though it's also offered by Sagen and Canada Guaranty. This insurance protects the lender (not you) in case you default on your mortgage.</p>
        <p>The premium is based on the size of your down payment relative to the home price:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>5% down:</strong> 4.00% premium</li>
          <li><strong>10% down:</strong> 3.10% premium</li>
          <li><strong>15% down:</strong> 2.80% premium</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The premium is added to your mortgage balance, so you pay it off over the life of the loan. On a $500,000 home with 5% down, the insurance premium would be about $19,000, bringing your total mortgage to approximately $494,000.</p>

        <h2>Getting Pre-Approved: Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>A mortgage pre-approval tells you exactly how much a lender is willing to lend you, based on your income, debts, credit score, and down payment. It also locks in an interest rate for 90 to 120 days, protecting you from rate increases while you shop for a home.</p>
        <p>A pre-approval is not a commitment to borrow &mdash; it's a planning tool. It gives you a realistic budget and shows sellers that you're a serious buyer. In competitive markets, an offer backed by a pre-approval carries significantly more weight.</p>

        <h2>Fixed vs. Variable Rate: Which Should You Choose?</h2>
        <p>This is one of the most common questions first-time buyers ask, and the answer depends on your risk tolerance and financial situation.</p>
        <p><strong>Fixed-rate mortgages</strong> lock in your interest rate for the entire term (typically 5 years). Your payment stays the same every month, making budgeting simple and predictable. Fixed rates are generally slightly higher than variable rates at the time of signing.</p>
        <p><strong>Variable-rate mortgages</strong> fluctuate with the Bank of Canada's overnight rate. When rates drop, more of your payment goes toward principal. When rates rise, more goes toward interest. Variable rates historically outperform fixed rates over the long term, but they come with uncertainty.</p>
        <p>If you're someone who needs predictability and would lose sleep over rising rates, go fixed. If you have some financial flexibility and can handle fluctuations, variable could save you money over the life of the mortgage.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Amortization</h2>
        <p>The amortization period is the total length of time it takes to pay off your mortgage in full. In Canada, the standard amortization for insured mortgages is 25 years. If your down payment is 20% or more, you may qualify for a 30-year amortization.</p>
        <p>A longer amortization means lower monthly payments but more interest paid over the life of the mortgage. A shorter amortization means higher payments but you're mortgage-free sooner and pay significantly less interest overall.</p>

        <h2>Closing Costs You Need to Budget For</h2>
        <p>Your down payment isn't the only cash you need. Budget an additional 1.5% to 4% of the purchase price for closing costs, which typically include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Land transfer tax:</strong> Varies by province. Ontario charges 0.5% to 2.5% on a sliding scale. Toronto adds a municipal land transfer tax on top of that.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal fees:</strong> $1,000 to $2,500 for a real estate lawyer to handle the title transfer and mortgage registration.</li>
          <li><strong>Home inspection:</strong> $400 to $600 for a qualified inspector to review the property.</li>
          <li><strong>Appraisal fee:</strong> $300 to $500 if your lender requires a property appraisal.</li>
          <li><strong>Title insurance:</strong> $250 to $500 to protect against title defects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Government Programs for First-Time Buyers</h2>
        <p>The Canadian government offers several programs to help first-time buyers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>First-Time Home Buyer Incentive:</strong> A shared-equity program where the government contributes 5% or 10% of the home's purchase price toward your down payment. You repay it when you sell or after 25 years.</li>
          <li><strong>Home Buyers' Plan (HBP):</strong> Withdraw up to $60,000 from your RRSP tax-free to put toward your first home. You repay the amount over 15 years.</li>
          <li><strong>First Home Savings Account (FHSA):</strong> Contribute up to $8,000 per year (lifetime max of $40,000) into a tax-advantaged account specifically for your first home purchase. Contributions are tax-deductible, and withdrawals for a qualifying home are tax-free.</li>
          <li><strong>First-Time Home Buyers' Tax Credit:</strong> A $10,000 non-refundable tax credit that provides up to $1,500 in tax relief.</li>
          <li><strong>Land Transfer Tax Rebates:</strong> Ontario offers a rebate of up to $4,000 for first-time buyers. Toronto offers an additional rebate of up to $4,475.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Stress Test: What It Is and Why It Exists</h2>
        <p>Every mortgage applicant in Canada must pass the mortgage stress test. This means you need to qualify at a rate that is the higher of your actual mortgage rate plus 2%, or the Bank of Canada's qualifying rate (currently 5.25%).</p>
        <p>The stress test is designed to make sure you can still afford your mortgage if rates rise. It does reduce the amount you can borrow, but it also protects you from overextending yourself financially.</p>

        <h2>Tips for First-Time Buyers</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Check your credit score early.</strong> A score above 680 opens the door to the best rates. If yours is lower, take 6 to 12 months to improve it before applying.</li>
          <li><strong>Get pre-approved before you start looking.</strong> It sets your budget and prevents you from falling in love with a home you can't afford.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't max out your budget.</strong> Just because you qualify for $600,000 doesn't mean you should spend $600,000. Leave room for maintenance, property taxes, and life.</li>
          <li><strong>Work with a mortgage broker.</strong> Brokers have access to dozens of lenders and can find rates and products your bank might not offer.</li>
          <li><strong>Read the fine print.</strong> Understand your prepayment privileges, penalty structure, and portability options before you sign.</li>
        </ul>
